#Introduction

Soil carbon storage is critical for soil health and stability, with Eurasian forest-steppe ecosystems having significant potential for carbon sequestration. Traditional methods to model soil organic matter variability are often complex, time-consuming, and limited in scope. Our repository offers a streamlined and efficient approach using machine learning to enhance predictions of soil organic matter distribution. By integrating ground sampling data and time series of spectral indices with remote-sensing data, our approach significantly improves accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.
